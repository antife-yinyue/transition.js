## Notes

- Defaults to place the transitions in the effects queue.
- You can stop the transitions by using `.stop()` method. For more information, see [$.fn.stop()](http://api.jquery.com/stop).
- The `complete` callback function is not sent any arguments, but `this` is set to the DOM element being transitioned.
- The transitions can be turned off globally by setting `$.fx.off = true`, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see [$.fx.off](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.fx.off).
